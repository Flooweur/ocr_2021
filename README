To use our OCR without the user interface:
1. use make to compile the project
2. use ./main "path_to_the_image" to let the image go through all of the code
3. you get a file named gridToSolve with the grid from the image that you can directly put in the solveur/ folder
4. when in the solver file you just have to use ./a.out gridToSolve to get the solved grid in the file gridToSolve.result
